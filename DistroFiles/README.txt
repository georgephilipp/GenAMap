Dear User,

Thank you for downloading GenAMap. To run GenAMap, please follow the instructions in Documentation/SettingUpGenAMap.pdf.

A description of how GenAMap works and the features available can be found in Documentation/IntroductionToGenAmap.pdf. Video tutorials of individual features and other documentation can be found online under http://sailing.cs.cmu.edu/genamap/tutorials.html.

One of trickiest aspects of using GenAMap is to format data correctly for importing it into the software. Please refer to Documentation/DataImportingGuide.pdf for detailed descriptions and Documentation/ExampleData for data file templates. 

For documentation on the algorithms embedded in GenAMap, please refer to Documentation/AlgorithmGuide.pdf

To improve GenAMap, we depend upon your input. We are happy about any and all kinds of questions / feedback / suggestions. Please email genamapsupport@cs.cmu.edu.

Note that GenAMap is a software under development. If you encounter a problem with the software (for example, a crash) or one of the algorithm, please restart the software / algorithm. If the problem persists, email genamapsupport@cs.cmu.edu. If the problem relates to data importing, you might find Documentation/IntroductionToGenAmap.pdf or the example files under Documentation/ExampleData helpful.

Thank you again for using GenAMap. We hope that you will find it useful.

Best Regards,
The GenAMap team
