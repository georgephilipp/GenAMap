Dear User,

Thank you for downloading GenAMap. To run GenAMap, please follow the instructions in Documentation/SettingUpGenAMap.pdf

One of trickiest aspects of using GenAMap is to format data correctly for importing it into the software. Please refer to Documentation/DataImportingGuide.pdf for detailed descriptions and Documentation/ExampleData for data file templates. Finally, it is possible to load further examples directly from within GenAMap by clicking on "example" or "?" in various data importing dialogs. 

There are several ways to learn more about GenAMap. For a quick overview, please refer to Documentation/Overview.pdf. The bulk of the documentation is online under http://cogito-b.ml.cmu.edu/genamap/. You may find the video walkthroughs at the top of http://cogito-b.ml.cmu.edu/genamap/tutorials.html particularly helpful.

For documentation on the algorithms embedded in GenAMap, please refer to Documentation/AlgorithmGuide.pdf

We are currently working on pulling different sources of documentation together to make the learning process easier for new users. 

To improve GenAMap, we depend upon your input. We are happy about any and all kinds of questions / feedback / suggestions. Please email genamapsupport@cs.cmu.edu 

Note that GenAMap is a software under development. If you encounter a problem with the software (for example, a crash) or one of the algorithm, please restart the software / algorithm. If the problem persists, email genamapsupport@cs.cmu.edu If the problem relates to data importing, you might find the resources references above helpful.

Thank you again for using GenAMap. We hope that you will find it useful.

Best Regards,
The GenAMap team
